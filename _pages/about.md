About me
======
I'm a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Milan-Bicocca and currently I'm involved in reasearch topics cencerning Spatial & Bayesian statistics, but I'm also interested in Statistical learning & R programming. 

Moreover, during my studies I had various work experiences: a curricular internship taken at a branch of the Remax real estate group in the province of Varese as Corporate and Data analyst (2018), an internship at Rapelli SA in Ticino (CH) as Data Analyst (2019) and finally an internship as Security Architect & Data Analyst at CyberGON (2021).

Thanks to the union of all these experiences I have developed a strong passion for all statistics fields, both theoretical and applied, and I hope one day to be able to make a significant contribution.

Now you can browse this portal for any details on my experiences, publications and research topics, but for all other information, question and collaboration I invite you to [download my updated CV](http://lucapresicce.github.io/files/paper1.pdf) & contact me on my social channels!
