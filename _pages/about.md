PhD student in Statistics at the University of Milan-Bicocca, where I received the MSc in Statistical and Economic Sciences with honors. Previously I obtained the BSc in Statistical Sciences with honors from the University of Bologna.

During my studies I had various work experiences: a curricular internship taken at a branch of the Remax real estate group in the province of Varese as Corporate and Data analyst (2018), an internship at Rapelli SA in Ticino (CH) as Data Analyst (2019) and finally an internship as Security Architect & Data Analyst at CyberGON (2021).
