About me
======
I'm a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Milan-Bicocca and currently I'm involved in reasearch topics cencerning **Spatial** & **Nonparametric Bayesian Statistics**, but I'm also interested in **Statistical Learning** & **R programming**. 

Moreover, during my studies I had various work experiences: a curricular internship taken at a branch of the REMAX group **(Real Estate)** in the province of Varese as **Corporate & Data analyst** (2018), an internship at Rapelli SA **(Food & Beverage)** in Ticino (CH) as **Data Analyst** (2019) and finally an internship at CyberGON **(Cyber Security)** as **Security Architect & Data Scientist** (2021).

Thanks to the union of all these experiences I have developed a strong passion for all statistics fields, both theoretical and applied, and I hope one day to be able to make a significant contribution.

Now you can browse this portal for any details on my experiences, publications and research topics, but for all other information, question and collaboration I invite you to [download my updated CV](http://lucapresicce.github.io/files/Curriculum.pdf) & **contact me on my social channels**!
