About me
======
I'm a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the **University of Milan-Bicocca**, and since May 2023 a Visiting Researcher at the **University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)** under the guidance of **Prof. Sudipto Banerjee**.

Currently, I'm involved in research topics concerning **Spatial** & **Bayesian Statistics**. In particular, I'm working on models for **Massive** & **Multivariate Geo-referenced data**, but I'm also interested in **Statistical Learning**, **Environmental Statistics**, **R programming**, and **High-Performance Computing**. 

Moreover, during my studies I had various work experiences: a curricular internship taken at a branch of the REMAX group **(Real Estate)** in the province of Varese as **Corporate & Data analyst** (2018), an internship at Rapelli SA **(Food & Beverage)** in Ticino (CH) as **Data Analyst** (2019) and finally an internship at CyberGON **(Cyber Security)** as **Security Architect & Data Scientist** (2021).

Thanks to the union of all these experiences I have developed a strong passion for all statistics fields: theoretical, methodological, and computational. I hope one day to make a significant contribution to the scientific community. Since the start of my PhD journey, I have been focused on this dream, while building an international network of academic relationships, exploring the scientific world, and working with some great Professors and researchers.  

Now you can browse this portal for any details on my experiences, publications, and research topics, but for all other information, questions, and collaboration I invite you to [download my updated CV](http://lucapresicce.github.io/files/Research_Curriculum.pdf) & **contact me on my social channels**!
