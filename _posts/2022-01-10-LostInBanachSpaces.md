**Why is studied Stefan's legacy from Statisticians?**

Why is studied Stefan's legacy from Statisticians?
------
This is the question that I make to myself since I started my journey in the PhD program.

But before to start talking, let me introduce myself and tell you something about what I do.
I'm Luca Presicce, as you can trivially read everywhere in this webiste, and from November 2021 I've start the PhD program in Statistics, in the University of Milan-Bicocca.

In general, I have always spent my days studying passionately, until the beginning of this path. Indeed, the firt year of PhD (composed of 28 cousers, more or less) was start with three courses of *Real & Functional Analysis*. 

Starting these courses, I was very exited, because I'm fascinated by mathematics, research methods and all the theoretical aspects (more or less complex) that regulate the tools that statisticians regularly use in their colorful days at work.
