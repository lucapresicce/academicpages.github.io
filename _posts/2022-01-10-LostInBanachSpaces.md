**Why is studied Stefan's legacy from Statisticians?**

Why is studied Stefan's legacy from Statisticians?
------
This is the question that I ask to myself since I started my journey in the PhD program.

Before start talking, let me introduce myself and tell you something about what I do.
I'm Luca Presicce, as you can trivially read everywhere in this webiste, and from November 2021 I've start the PhD program in Statistics, at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

In general, I have always spent my days studying passionately, until the beginning of this path. Indeed, the first year of PhD (composed by 28 cousers, more or less) was start with three courses of *Real & Functional Analysis*. 

Starting these courses, I was very excited, because I'm fascinated by mathematics, research methods and all the theoretical aspects (more or less complex) which regulate the tools that statisticians regularly use in their colorful days at work.
