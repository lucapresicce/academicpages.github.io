**Why is studied Stefan's legacy from Statisticians?**

Why is studied Stefan's legacy from Statisticians?

This is the answer that I make to myself since I started my journey in the PhD program.

But before to start talking, let me introduce myself and tell you something about what I do.
I'm Luca Presicce, as you can trivially read everywhere in this webiste, and from November 2021 I've start the PhD program in Statistics, in the University of Milan-Bicocca.
